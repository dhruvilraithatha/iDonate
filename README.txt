Blood donation is an application which can be used by hospitals when they require urgent blood for their patients. 
This app solves the problem of manually calling all the donors and asking them if they are available. Rather than calling each person and asking them if
they are available, using this app you can send a request to the user and they can either accept it or deny it. 
The manager/admin at the blood bank will get a confirmation once they accept the request. 
If they accept they can reach the hospital and donate their blood.
The application also provides a map to easily find the hospital is they are unaware as to where the hospital/blood bank is located. 
If a user needs blood for themselves or their relatives/friends he/she can request to hospital for blood.
